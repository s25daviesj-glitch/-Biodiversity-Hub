                        <p>Biodiversity is short for "biological diversity." It means the variety of all living things on Earth - from the tiniest bacteria to the largest whales, and from simple mosses to complex rainforest ecosystems.</p>

                            <p>Scientists have discovered about 1.5 million different species, but they estimate there could be 8-100 million species on Earth!</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Think of biodiversity like a giant puzzle - every species is a unique piece that helps complete the picture of life on Earth. Just like removing pieces from a puzzle makes it incomplete, losing species makes our planet's ecosystems less stable.</p>

                        <p>The variety of genes within a species. This is why people have different eye colors, or why some dogs are small while others are large.</p>
                        <div class="example">
                            <strong>Example:</strong> Different breeds of dogs all belong to the same species but have very different characteristics due to genetic diversity.

                        <p>The variety of different species in an area. A rainforest has high species diversity because many different plants and animals live there.</p>
